# Quick test to verify the issue with Added During Sprint calculation

# From the logs, we can see:
# Issue Keys Added During Sprint: {'SCAL-266698': True, 'SCAL-266731': True, ...}
# But our calculation shows: Added During Sprint: 0

# The problem is we're checking if it's a list, but it's actually a dictionary!
