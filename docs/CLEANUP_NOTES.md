# Code Cleanup - HTML to React Migration

## Changes Made

### ✅ Removed Old HTML Files
- Deleted `/templates/` directory (contained old HTML templates)
- Deleted `/static/` directory (contained old static HTML files)
- Kept only `/frontend/public/index.html` (React app entry point)

### ✅ Updated Flask App (`app.py`)
- Removed `static_folder` and `static_url_path` configuration
- Removed `render_template` and `send_from_directory` imports
- Removed old HTML serving routes:
  - `@app.route('/')` - served old HTML
  - `@app.route('/<path:path>')` - served static files
  - `@app.route('/debug-openai')` - debug HTML page
  - `@app.route('/simple-test')` - test HTML page
  - `@app.route('/share/<share_id>')` - shared report HTML page

### ✅ Current Architecture
- **Frontend**: React app served by Docker container on port 8080
- **Backend**: Flask API server (can run on different port)
- **Communication**: React frontend makes API calls to Flask backend

### ✅ Benefits
- No more confusion between old HTML UI and React UI
- Cleaner codebase with single frontend technology
- Better maintainability
- Modern React-based user interface

## Files Removed
- `/templates/index.html`
- `/templates/error.html`
- `/templates/shared_report.html`
- `/templates/simple_test.html`
- `/static/index.html`

## Files Kept
- `/frontend/public/index.html` (React app entry point)
- All React components in `/frontend/src/components/`
- Flask API routes (all `/api/*` endpoints)

## Temporary Files Cleaned Up
- Removed `/temp_screenshots/` directory (empty)
- Removed `jira_settings.json.bak` backup file
- Removed `frontend/npm-debug.log` debug log
- Removed `__pycache__/` directories (Python cache)
- Removed `scripts/__pycache__/` directory (Python cache)
- Removed `minimal_app.py` (standalone test server)
- Removed `NOT_COMPLETED_FIX.md` (outdated bug fix documentation)
- Removed `NOT_COMPLETED_FIX_V2.md` (outdated bug fix documentation)
- Removed `PUSH_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (outdated Git push instructions)

## Project Reorganization
- **Backend**: All Python files moved to `/backend/` folder
- **Frontend**: React app remains in `/frontend/` folder  
- **Config**: Configuration files moved to `/config/` folder
- **Docs**: Documentation moved to `/docs/` folder
- **Structure**: Created `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` for detailed organization

## Next Steps
- Ensure Docker container is running the React app
- Verify all API endpoints work with React frontend
- Test the application end-to-end
- Update any hardcoded paths in scripts to reflect new structure
