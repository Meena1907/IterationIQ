# 🔧 "Not Completed" Count Calculation Fix

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**

The "Not Completed" count was showing incorrect values due to inconsistent calculation methods. The issue was that the system was counting issues added during the sprint as "Not Completed" when they shouldn't be.

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Three Different Calculation Methods Found:**

1. **Method 1: Direct count from `incomplete_issues`**
   ```python
   not_completed_count = len(incomplete_issues)
   ```
   - **Problem**: Includes issues added during sprint
   - **Result**: Incorrectly high "Not Completed" count

2. **Method 2: Formula-based calculation**
   ```python
   not_completed_count = len(issues_not_completed_in_current_sprint) - len(issue_keys_added_during_sprint)
   ```
   - **Problem**: Only used when `incomplete_issues` is empty
   - **Result**: Correct calculation when used

3. **Method 3: Fallback calculation**
   ```python
   # Only counts initially planned issues
   ```
   - **Problem**: Only used when Sprint Report API fails
   - **Result**: Correct calculation when used

## ✅ **The Fix Applied**

### **Before (Incorrect):**
```python
else:
    not_completed_count = len(incomplete_issues)  # ❌ Includes added issues
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```python
else:
    # FIXED: Filter out issues that were added during sprint from incomplete_issues
    # This ensures we only count issues that were planned at start but not completed
    incomplete_issues_planned_at_start = []
    for issue in incomplete_issues:
        issue_key = issue.get('key', '')
        if issue_key not in issue_keys_added_during_sprint:
            incomplete_issues_planned_at_start.append(issue)
    
    not_completed_count = len(incomplete_issues_planned_at_start)  # ✅ Excludes added issues
```

## 📊 **What This Fixes**

### **Before Fix:**
- **Sprint Start**: 20 issues planned
- **During Sprint**: 5 issues added
- **Sprint End**: 18 completed, 7 not completed
- **"Not Completed" Count**: 7 (❌ **WRONG** - includes 2 added issues)

### **After Fix:**
- **Sprint Start**: 20 issues planned  
- **During Sprint**: 5 issues added
- **Sprint End**: 18 completed, 7 not completed
- **"Not Completed" Count**: 5 (✅ **CORRECT** - only planned issues)

## 🎯 **Business Logic**

### **"Not Completed" Should Represent:**
- Issues that were **committed to at sprint start**
- But were **not completed** by sprint end
- This measures **sprint commitment fulfillment**

### **"Not Completed" Should NOT Include:**
- Issues added during the sprint (scope creep)
- These weren't part of the original commitment
- They shouldn't count against sprint performance

## 🔄 **Impact on Other Metrics**

### **Initial Planned**: ✅ Unchanged
- Still correctly shows issues planned at sprint start

### **Added During Sprint**: ✅ Unchanged  
- Still correctly shows scope changes

### **Completed**: ✅ Unchanged
- Still correctly shows completed work

### **Completion %**: ✅ **IMPROVED**
- Now calculated as: `Completed / (Completed + Not Completed)`
- More accurate since "Not Completed" is now correct

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

To verify the fix works:

1. **Run a sprint report** with the updated code
2. **Check debug output** for the new filtering logic
3. **Verify "Not Completed"** only includes originally planned issues
4. **Compare with Jira's burndown chart** - should now match

## 📝 **Debug Output Added**

The fix includes enhanced debug logging:
```
DEBUG - Using filtered incompletedIssues for not_completed_count: 5 (original: 7, filtered: 5)
```

This shows:
- **Original count**: 7 (before filtering)
- **Filtered count**: 5 (after removing added issues)
- **Difference**: 2 issues were added during sprint

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy the fix** to your environment
2. **Test with real sprint data** 
3. **Verify calculations** match Jira's native reports
4. **Monitor for any edge cases** in different sprint scenarios
